 * The function `useForwardPropsEmits` takes in props and an optional emit function, and returns a

 * @param {T} props - The `props` parameter is of type `T`, which is a generic type that extends the
 * parameters of the `useForwardProps` function. It represents the props object that is passed to the
 * `useForwardProps` function.
 * @param [emit] - The `emit` parameter is a function that can be used to emit events. It takes two
 * arguments: `name`, which is the name of the event to be emitted, and `args`, which are the arguments
 * to be passed along with the event.
 * @returns a computed property that combines the parsed
 * props and emits as props.
